# Movie Project - Phase 3

A python application to store, manage, and view a collection of your favorite movies using an interactive CLI and an OMDb API integration with SQLite.

## Purpose
The primary purpose is to keep an organized, locally accessible offline rating scale of movies you watch, alongside all of their metadata such as the posters and release years.

## Setup
1. Ensure your API keys are stored in a local `.env` file (e.g. `API_KEY=...`)
2. Install dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `python add_movies.py` to automatically add a curated selection of 40 movies to your database for testing out all the new features!
4. Everything is automatically configured!

## Usage
Launch the application with `python movies.py` and use the interactive numeric UI prompts.

## Features
- Advanced Search and Add functions for movies.
- Display statistics (averages, best/worst film).
- Plot and save a rating histogram to your drive.
- Instantly export your collection into a graphical HTML website!
